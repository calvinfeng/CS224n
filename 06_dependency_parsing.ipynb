    "## Linguistic Structure\n",
    "There are two views on linguistic structure.\n",
    "1. Phrase structure organizes words into nested constituents.\n",
    "    * So-called context-free grammars\n",
    "    * Working up the Chomsky hierarchy\n",
    "2. Dependency structure shows which words depend on which other words.\n",
    "    * A key parsing decision is how we attach various constituents\n",
    "    \n",
    "We will focus on the second view on linguistic structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Rise of Annotated Data\n",
    "Treebank is a parsed text corpus that annotates syntactic or semantic sentence structure. \n",
    "![tree-bank](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/The_house_at_the_end_of_the_street.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a tree bank seems a lot slower and less userful than coming up with an universal grammar rule. But a treebank gives us many times.\n",
    "* Reusability of labor\n",
    "* Broad coverage, not just few intuitions\n",
    "* Frequencies and distributional information\n",
    "* A way to evaluate systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependency Syntax\n",
    "Dependency syntax postulates that syntactic structure consists of relations between lexical items, normally binary asymmetric relations (\"arrows\") called dependencies. The arrows are commonly **typed** with the name of grammatical relations (e.g. subject, prepositional object, apposition, etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependency Grammar History\n",
    "The idea of dependency structure goes back a long way\n",
    "* Panini's grammar in 5th century BCE\n",
    "* Basic approach of 1st millenium Arabic grammarians\n",
    "  \n",
    "Constituency and context free grammars are new-fangled inventions.\n",
    "* 20th century invention by R.S. Wells\n",
    "    \n",
    "Modern dependency work is often linked to work of L. Tesniere (1959)\n",
    "* Dominant approach in the *East*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependency Conditioning Preferences\n",
    "What are the sources of information for dependency parsing?\n",
    "1. Bilexical affinities\n",
    "2. Dependency distance\n",
    "3. Intervening material\n",
    "4. Valency of heads\n",
    "\n",
    "A sentence is parsed by choosing for each word what other word (including **ROOT**) is it a dependent of. Usually some constraints are applied.\n",
    "* Only one word is a dependent of ROOT\n",
    "* Dependency cannot be cyclic\n",
    "\n",
    "This means dependency is a tree. The final issue is whether arrows can cross (non-projective) or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "![dependency-tree](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Latex-dependency-parse-example-with-tikz-dependency.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods of Dependency Parsing\n",
    "1. Dynamic programming - Eisner (1996) gives a clever algorithm with complexity O(n^3), b producing a parse items with heads at the ends rather than in the middle.\n",
    "2. Graph algorithms - Create a minimum spanning tree for a sentence\n",
    "3. Constraint satisfaction - Edges are eliminated that don't satisfy hard constraints\n",
    "4. Transition-based parsing or deterministic dependency parsing - Greedy choice of attachments guided by good machine learning classifiers \n",
    "\n",
    "## Arc-standard Transition-based Parser\n",
    "This is the primary parser architecture we will be using throughout CS224n. This is a simple form of greedy discriminative dependency parser. The parser does a sequence of bottom up actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser has\n",
    "* A stack written with top to the right, which starts with ROOT symbol \n",
    "* A buffer, written with top to the left, which starts with the input sentence\n",
    "* A set of dependency arcs `A` which starts off empty\n",
    "* A set of actions\n",
    "    * Shift\n",
    "    * Left-arc\n",
    "    * Right-arc\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "input_sentence = \"I ate fish\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We start off with root in a stack and the tokens of the sentence in a buffer, and an empty set of arcs. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "arcs = dict()\n",
    "stack = ['ROOT']\n",
    "buffer = ['I', 'ate', 'fish']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shift\n",
    "We do a shift, which is taking the first word from the buffer (left to right ordering) and put it onto the stack.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "shift(stack, buffer)\n",
    "print stack # => ['ROOT', 'I']\n",
    "print buffer # => ['ate', 'fish'] \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We shift again!\n",
    "```python\n",
    "shift(stack, buffer)\n",
    "print stack # => ['ROOT', 'I', 'ate']\n",
    "print buffer # => ['fish'] \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Left Arc \n",
    "Now we should be doing a left arc action. We remove the second top item from the stack and put it into the arc set because we can see that `'I'` is dependent of `'ate'`. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "left_arc(stack, buffer, arcs)\n",
    "print stack # => ['ROOT', 'ate']\n",
    "print buffer # => ['fish']\n",
    "print arcs # => { 'nsubj': ('ate', 'I') }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Shift again\n",
    "```python\n",
    "shift(stack, buffer)\n",
    "print stack # => ['ROOT', 'ate', 'fish']\n",
    "print buffer # => []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Right Arc\n",
    "At this point the buffer is empty. We do the final two right arc(s), which is to say the top of stack should be made a dependent of the thing that's second top item from the stack.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "right_arc(stack, buffer, arcs)\n",
    "print stack # => ['ROOT', 'ate'] \n",
    "print buffer # => []\n",
    "print arcs # => { 'nsubj': ('ate', 'I') , 'obj': ('ate', 'fish') }\n",
    "\n",
    "right_arc(stack, buffer, arcs)\n",
    "print stack # => ['ROOT']\n",
    "print buffer # => []\n",
    "print arcs # => { 'nsubj': ('ate', 'I') , 'obj': ('ate', 'fish'), 'root': ('ROOT', 'ate') }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action Decision?\n",
    "Done! But how do we decide which action to take during parsing? We need to train a classifier to do that. More on this in next lecture."
